# DroiD66

DroiD64 is a graphical file manager for D64, D67, D71, D80, D81, D82, D88, D90, T64 and LNX files.
This is a file manager for disk-images suitable for the Commodore 64 and others.
These disk-images are usually stored as .D64 files having a size of 174848 bytes.
The idea with DroiD64 is to make life easier for Commodore 64 fans, especially for those using MAC and Linux systems as there are tools available for Windows anyway.
