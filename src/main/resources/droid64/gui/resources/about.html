<h1>About, credits and greetings</h1>
<p>DroiD64 is a file manager for disk-images suitable for the Commodore 64 and others.
These disk-images are usually stored as .D64 files and have the size of 174848 bytes.</p>
<p>May this tool make life easier for Commodore 64 fans, especially for those using MAC and Linux systems 
as there are tools available for Windows anyway.
